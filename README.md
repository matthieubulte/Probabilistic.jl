# Probabilistic.jl

Probabilistic.jl is an attempt to provide lightweight and easy to use probabilistic programming in Julia.

```julia
# TODO: describe the library. Until then, see examples/
```

### About

I got interested in probabilistic programming languages after watching a talk from Dan Roy [1] and decided to give it a try after reading a gist from Char Scherrer, implementing a probabilistic modeling DSLs in Julia through program transformation [2].

The goal of this project is for me is twofold:
 - learn about the implementation of probabilistic programming languages
 - have an interesting use case of SMC algorithms, which is the subject of my bachelor thesis.
